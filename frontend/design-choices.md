- I've decided to go ahead with Vite + React for familiarity and its easy integration with Vite, ensuring a fast development.
- The React query tool was picked due to its powerful mutations integrations, allowing the data obtainance straightforward.
- Tailwind was picked because it allows customization and fast development due to the style classes provided.

The approach mets the functional criteria providing a powerful single page application that has all the functionalities provided, working and proved. The non-functional requirement is met because the design ties to the original design, and the user experience is clean, errorless and responsive.
